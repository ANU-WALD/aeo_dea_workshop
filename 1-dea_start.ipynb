For example, clouds, cloud shadows, missing data, saturation and water are common pixel level attributes.\n",

    "#### Optical sensors mounted on satellites measure the energy that comes from the sun and has been reflected by the Earth's surface. The sensor measures the energy in each of its spectral bands. There are many factors that affect the amount of energy that reaches the satellite sensor such as the solar and satellite angles relative to the surface and the atmospheric conditions. In order to analyse and compare images taken at different times, the data needs to be normalised into some standard conditions. Surface reflectance is one of this normalisations and is calculated using advanced physical models to correct the reflectance values taking into account atmospheric conditions, sun and satellite angles and local topography.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DEA offers to options for adjusted or normalised surface reflectance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NBAR**: NBAR stands for *Nadir-corrected BRDF Adjusted Reflectance*, where BRDF stands for *Bidirectional reflectance distribution function*. The approach involves atmospheric correction to compute bottom-of-atmosphere radiance, and bi-directional reflectance modelling to remove the effects of topography and angular variation in reflectance. NBAR can be useful for analyses in extremely flat areas not affected by terrain shadow, and for producing attractive data visualisations that are not affected by NBART's nodata gaps (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NBART**: NBART has the same features of NBAR but includes an additional *terrain illumination* reflectance correction that takes into account the surface topography. Terrain affects optical satellite images in a number of ways; for example, slopes facing the sun receive more sunlight and appear brighter compared to those facing away from the sun. This correction is performed with a Digital Surface Model (DSM). NBART is typically the default choice for performing analysis that are consistent through time. However, it can be introduce distortion in flat areas due to the noise in DSM data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Comparison between NBAR and NBART](data/nbar_nbart_animation.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The animation above demonstrates how the NBART correction results in a significantly more two-dimensional looking image that is less affected by terrain illumination and shadow. Black pixels in the NBART image represent areas of deep terrain shadow that can't be corrected as they're determined not to be viewable by either the sun or the satellite. These are represented by -999 `nodata` values in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Remember that remote sensing data is often stored as `uint16` to save space and `NaN` is only available for floating point types, that is why we need a value `-999` in this case to designate not-a-number data."
